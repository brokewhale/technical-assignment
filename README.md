Thank you for taking the time for this technical assignment. We expect you to finish the assignment in about ~4 hours. We encourage you to submit even if you did not completely finish. This assignment is more about getting to know your development style and how you approach building new functionalities.

After completing the assignment you may be invited to a follow-up interview where we do some collaborative coding based on your code.


## Technical Assignment

The assignment is to create a functioning schedule overview that let's visitors view, filter and sort the `Democon` event. The schedule data can be found at `src/data/schedule.json`. 


### Requirements 

- [ ] Use this repository, with Next.js framework for development
- [ ] Use TypeScript
- [ ] Use React function components and hooks
- [ ] Use Sass for designing the components
- [ ] Use all the available event data `schedule.json` for the schedule overview
- [ ] The app should be responsive and work well on mobile and desktop
- [ ] You should be able to sort and filter the schedule by day, track and room

This assignment purposefully lacks further details. We leave it up to your creativity to scope and build out the schedule overview and all required components. If you want to add any additional functionalities or pages that would add something to the experience, feel free, but please keep in mind the time limit.


### Deliverables

Copy or create a fork of this repository into your personal account on Github. Please make it a private repository. Invite `@wslyvh` and `@lassejaco` to it.

Please include:
1. a working solution with all the code necessary to run the application
1. any documentation (if necessary) that is required to run the application (see # Getting Started)
1. any additional information on why you build the application this way, any thing you'd done differently if you had more time or any other information that you think would be hellpful to review (see # Additional Info)

## Getting Started

Running the development server:

```
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
